  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the CCP1 driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs 

  @Description
    This source file provides implementations for driver APIs for CCP1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs  - 1.45
        Device            :  PIC16LF18855
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.40
