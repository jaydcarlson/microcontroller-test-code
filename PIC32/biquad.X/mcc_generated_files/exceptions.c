  @Summary:
    This is the generated driver implementation file for handling traps
    using PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs traps.
    Generation Information : 
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - pic24-dspic-pic32mm : v1.35
        Device            :  PIC32MM0064GPL028
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC32 1.42
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.60
